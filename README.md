#System Audit on the cloud to manage an IT remotely
System Audit on the cloud is a solution to register and do a basic IT managent of your IT on the cloud. 

## How it works
You register your IT computers or laptops on the cloud with the C# application (on Windows) or script on script on Linux.
Then you enter to the webapp and you can do basic managment (at this demo we did WOL, shutdown and data track of your computers).
It can be improved to do more features.

 
## Demo case to local test

Put the WWW folder on a webserver and you go to localhost. There you have a control panel to check. 
You can virtualize several computers to test it.
